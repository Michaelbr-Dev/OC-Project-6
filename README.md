## Script

You've spent the past year as a freelance back-end developer working on multiple projects of varying sizes and difficulties.

Last week, you received a message on your freelance platform asking for help with a new project. Hot sauces are growing in popularity, thanks in large part to the "Hot Ones" YouTube series. That's why this new client, the brand of chili-based condiments Piiquante, wants to develop a hot sauce review web application called "Hot Takes".

</p>

If Piiquante's product manager wants to eventually turn the review app into an online store, she wants the first version to be a "sauce gallery" allowing users to upload their favorite hot sauces and like or dislike them. sauces that others share. The app's front-end was developed using Angular and was pre-compiled after internal testing, but Piiquante needs a back-end developer to build the API.

The deadline is reasonable, so you decide to accept the project.

### Back end Installation

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. You can then run the server with `node server`.

The server should run on localhost with default port 3000. If the server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the console when the server starts, e.g. Listening on port 3001.
